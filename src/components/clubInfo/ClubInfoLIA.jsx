              The Literary and Interactive Arts Club is a vibrant community of
              young artists and creative thinkers who come together to explore
              their passions and hone their talents. The club will be focusing
              on Visual Arts (Music, Dance, Instruments, and Theatre), Creative
              Writing, and Digital Content Creation. We foster creativity,
              innovation, and self-expression through an array of activities
              that cater different artistic disciplines and philosophy. We
              encourage our members to explore new ideas, collaborate with
              others, and pursue their passions.
