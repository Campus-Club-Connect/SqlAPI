              Scouting has come a long way since its introduction in Bhutan in
              1970 as a Non-Governmental Organization, supported by Druk Gyalpo
              Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. Rover Scouts, a group specifically
              designed for young adults in tertiary institutions and colleges,
              offer an array of opportunities for personal development,
              exploration, and adventure.
